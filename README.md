## About This Project

This is an example usage of https://github.com/bdelespierre/php-kmeans.
This is an example usage and calculation of KMeans Algorithm.

In this project, i want to learn how to implement the
Algorithm to some data, that might be usefull for
me or anyone that what to use it.

I want to make the CRUD an Calculation Software to Implement
The Algorithm and Calculate some data to it.

Still alot of work to do, for example:
- Make the view.
- Make the form.
- Show the detailed result, such as :
    - Show the point distance to the centroid (might be helpfull and usefull to show distance from the centroid on every iteration). => DONE!
    - Injecting the initialization centroid (manual selection first centroid). => DONE!
    - Show how many iteration has been done. => DONE!
    - Group the data base on each iteration. => DONE!

You can take a look how i implement the Library From HomeController.php
